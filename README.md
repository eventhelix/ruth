### Book Structure

The book is divided into seven parts, each focusing on different aspects of Rust's inner workings:

1. **Introduction to Assembly and Basic Constructs:** Start with the basics of assembly language and see how Rust translates simple functions into assembly code.
2. **Control Structures and Enums in Assembly:** Explore the assembly output of match and if-else expressions and understand the memory layout of enums.
3. **Data Structures and Memory Management:** Investigate the performance nuances of various data structures and memory management techniques in Rust.
4. **Iteration and Optimization:** Compare traditional and functional iteration methods and learn how the Rust compiler optimizes array operations.
5. **Strings, Dispatch, and Recursion:** Dive into the inner workings of strings, dynamic dispatch, and recursive function optimization.
6. **Closures and Async/Await:** Understand the mechanics of closures and asynchronous functions and how Rust translates them into efficient state machines.
7. **Transformations and Takeaways:** Summarize key insights and transformations, providing a solid foundation for future Rust projects.
